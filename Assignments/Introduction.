Namaste everyone,

I'm Dharmendra choudhary. i'm a middler at vellore institute of technology(VIT),Tamil Nadu, India studying Information Technology(IT). I have developed several softwares GUI or Non-GUI based on C++, python, Java, .NET etc but i always felt that they could be made better if i knew a proper paradigm. as we know software product management is  a sub-discipline of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled. making a software product randomly is a noob thing so i decided to learn software product management so that i can develop a proper software which can made in conceptual way and can be altered and assesed at different stages so as to make it optimal.
